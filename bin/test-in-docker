# This script mounts the contents of the current directory into the Harmony docker image and runs the test
# suite.  It is meant to allow development and testing without repeatedly rebuilding the docker image.  To
# run a completely clean container using only what is in the image, as will be done in CI environments,
# run:
# `docker run --rm -it --env-file=.env ghcr.io/nasa/harmony-netcdf-to-zarr-test`

# If the optional environment variable LOCAL_SVCLIB_DIR is set to the directory
# of a local clone of the `harmony-service-lib-py` repo, it will be mounted
# into the running container and installed so that all tests will also use
# any changes in that local repo.
